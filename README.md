## Project Description:

In this project, you will be creating a course management system. The system will have the following features:

1.  Create a course with its properties (course name, course duration, course modules, course fee.)
2.  Add students to the course and assign them a fee.
3.  Display the details of the course.
4.  Display the details of the students in the course.

## Instructions:
1.  Create a dictionary to store the course details. The dictionary should have the following keys: 'course_name', 'course_duration', 'course_modules', 'course_fee'.
2.  Create a function to add a course. The function should take the course details as input and add them to the dictionary.
3.  Create a function to add students to the course. The function should take the student's name and fee as input and add them to a list of students.
4.  Create a function to display the course details. The function should print the details of the course.
5.  Create a function to display the students in the course. The function should print the names and fees of the students.
6.  Test your functions by adding a course and some students, and displaying the course and student details.
